## GitDeclare

Declarative Git Processing. Instead of committing haphazardly, GitDeclare watches for all changes every second and auto commits them for you. You can declare your intentions to work on something and then reap the benefits of having a snapshot of all changes done in a session.

In addition, if you don't like the changes, you can delete them.
